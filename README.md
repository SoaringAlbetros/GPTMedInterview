# Medical AI Interviewer Version 0.1.2

This repository is an adaptation of the original [GPTInterviewer](https://github.com/jiatastic/GPTInterviewer) designed specifically for medical interviews. The primary goal of this adaptation is to facilitate efficient and structured interviews for first-time patients, gathering essential medical history and current health information.

## Purpose

The Medical AI Interviewer aims to:

- **Streamline Patient Onboarding:** Reduce the time taken for initial consultations by gathering preliminary information before the patient meets the doctor.
  
- **Standardize Interviews:** Ensure that all essential questions are asked consistently for every patient, reducing the chances of missing critical information.
  
- **Enhance Patient Experience:** Allow patients to provide their medical history and concerns in a structured manner, ensuring they feel heard and understood.

## Features

- **Customized Medical Questions:** Tailored questions based on various medical categories such as Uro-Genital, Bone, Skin, and more.
  
- **Session State Management:** Track patient responses to ensure context is maintained throughout the interview.
  
- **Secure Data Storage:** Patient responses are saved securely, ensuring data privacy and compliance with medical regulations.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Interview:** Launch the Medical AI Interviewer and begin the interview process.
  
2. **Answer Questions:** The patient will be prompted with a series of medical questions. Answer each question to the best of your ability.
  
3. **Review & Submit:** At the end of the interview, review the provided information and submit it. The data will be securely stored and made available to the medical practitioner for the consultation.
